Description: We introduce a robust matrix factor model that explicitly incorporates tail behavior and employs a mean-shift term to avoid efficiency losses through pre-centering of observed matrices. More details on the methods related to our paper are currently under submission. A full reference to the paper will be provided in future versions once the paper is published.
